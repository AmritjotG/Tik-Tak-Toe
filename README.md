# Tik-Tak-Toe

The provided code is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. It uses a 2D vector to represent the game board and allows two players, 'X' and 'O', to take turns entering their moves. The game checks for a winning condition after each move to determine if a player has won. It also checks if the board is full to detect a tie. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full. If a valid move is entered, it updates the board and switches to the next player. The players' moves and the game state are displayed on the console using simple text output.
